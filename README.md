Lung-cancer-prediction-using-ANN
Lung cancer is the primary cause of cancer-related deaths globally. This cancer is majorly observed  in smokers, increasing air pollution has also begun to affect non-smokers. Research indicates that exposure to polluted air significantly raises the risk of developing lung cancer, posing a major threat to public health. Despite advancements in medical technology, the mortality_rate_from_lung_cancer remains high, highlighting the importance of early diagnosis ._Machine learningiiand deep learning offer promising solutions for early and accurate prediction through advanced data analysis. In our study, we utilized a dataset with 26 attributes for discern lung cancer, categorizing cases into three risk levels: high, medium, and low. We applied various algorithms and develop_an ArtificialllNeural_Network(ANN), comparing the overall  performance with various machine-learning and deep-learning models. Our results show that the ANN achieved a high accuracy of 94.9% using the Adam optimizer, making it an effective model for lung cancer prediction.
